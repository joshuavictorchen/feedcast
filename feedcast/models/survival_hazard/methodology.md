# Survival Hazard

Hazard-based point-forecast model that frames each feeding episode as a
survival event whose likelihood increases with elapsed time. Uses a
Weibull hazard function with a configured overnight/daytime split to
capture the structurally different feeding regimes.

Raw bottle feeds are collapsed into feeding episodes, removing
cluster-internal gaps that would otherwise contaminate the gap
distribution. All model computation — scale estimation, conditional
survival, simulation — operates on episode-level data.

Overnight episodes follow a higher-shape Weibull: more regular timing
with tighter clustering around the median. Daytime episodes follow a
lower-shape Weibull: more variable timing with a broader spread. The
scale parameter for each period is estimated at runtime from recent
same-period episode gaps, allowing the model to track the baby's
changing pace.

The forecast uses the median of the Weibull survival function as the
point prediction — the time at which there is a 50% probability the
next feed has occurred. The first predicted feed accounts for the time
already elapsed since the last observed episode using the conditional
survival function. Later predicted feeds chain deterministic Weibull
medians rather than sampling from the full distribution.

This methodology intentionally stays at the level of mechanism. Current
fitted values, empirical comparisons, and replay evidence live in
`artifacts/research_results.txt`. Current production constants live in `model.py`.
